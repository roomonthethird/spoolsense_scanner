# TODO

## In Progress
- **ESP32-S3 support** — board profile define exists, needs hardware testing and any S3-specific pin/peripheral adjustments

## Bugs

- **Spoolman 400 on spool create** — `openprinttag_uuid` in the extra field is double-escaped (`"\"DAD4E374080104E0\""` instead of `"DAD4E374080104E0"`); every new spool create fails with HTTP 400
- **setupRF() stuck after ISO15693 read** — after a successful multi-block read, `setupRF()` fails on the next scan loop iteration; currently patched with `lastSeenValid` clear to force a hardware reset, but the root cause (PN5180 RF state not cleanly restored after batched reads) is unresolved — side effect is repeated SpoolDetected events and Spoolman spam each cycle
- **ENABLE_STATUS_LED is a no-op** — defined in `UserConfig.h` and stored in `DeviceConfig` but never wired into any `#if` guard; actual LED compilation is controlled by `USE_STATUS_LED` in `platformio.ini`, making the UserConfig define misleading
- **Spoolman material mismatch** — serial log showed tag written as ABS but Spoolman matched it to TPU (filament id=3); likely a vendor/filament lookup bug or stale test data in Spoolman, needs investigation
- **Remaining legacy `openprinttag` naming** — several files still reference the old identity: BLE device name in `BluetoothManager.cpp`, HTML title in `docs/index.html`, project name in `CMakeLists.txt`, and `.code-workspace` filename

## Planned

### Tag Format Support
- **OpenTag3D** — support as an additional tag format (long-term, `TagKind::OpenTag3D` is reserved)

### Performance
- **Instrument the write path** — add timing logs for each phase: format duration, number of blocks written, total write time, verify duration; output something like `format=320ms blocks=11 write=1840ms verify=410ms`; needed before any optimization to know where time is actually spent
- **Dirty-block write optimization** — investigate whether the current write path already skips unchanged blocks or writes all blocks every time; writing only dirty blocks is the biggest firmware-side win available without changing libraries
- **Blank vs. existing tag write time** — format step adds writes before the payload even starts; profile separately to understand if slow writes are blank-tag-only or affect rewrites too
- **Write Multiple Blocks investigation** — check whether the SLIX2 tags in use support ISO15693 Write Multiple Blocks (command 0x24); if so, batching block writes could reduce round-trips; note: many tags do not support this command so verify against tag datasheet first

### Firmware / Infrastructure
- **OTA firmware updates** — support over-the-air updates via WiFi so deployed scanners can be updated without USB reflash; ESP32 Arduino OTA is available
- **MQTT reconnect robustness** — audit whether `HomeAssistantManager` cleanly handles broker drops and reconnects in long-running deployments; verify subscriptions are re-established after reconnect
- **Configurable log verbosity** — add `LOG_LEVEL` define to `UserConfig.h` (e.g. DEBUG/INFO/WARN) to reduce serial noise in production without losing full output for debugging

### Web / UI
- **Status page** — add a landing page at `http://spoolsense.local/` showing current spool, WiFi signal, MQTT status, uptime, and free heap; makes the device debuggable without serial access
- **Web-based config** — add a protected config page at `spoolsense.local/config` to replace BLE-based configuration; allow WiFi/MQTT/Spoolman settings to be changed without reflashing
- **Installer script** — interactive setup script that walks the user through WiFi, MQTT, Spoolman, board selection, and optional hardware, then generates `UserConfig.h` and flashes the device

### Hardware / Build
- **LED pin configurable via UserConfig.h** — currently `STATUS_LED_PIN` is set in `platformio.ini` build flags; move to `UserConfig.h` alongside `ENABLE_STATUS_LED`
- **Scanner naming** — configurable name (e.g. `Toolhead1-scanner`, `Lane1-scanner`) via `UserConfig.h`, reflected in BLE device name and MQTT topics

### Debugging / Logging
- **No serial output on tag write** — when the web UI triggers a write, nothing is logged to serial; add a write-dispatched log line to make debugging easier

### Integration
- **Spoolman write support** — write spool data fetched from Spoolman directly to a tag via BLE UI

### Architecture / Overlap to Resolve
- **Dual weight-sync ownership** — both `SpoolmanManager` (scanner) and the SpoolSense middleware `tag_sync` module can write updated remaining weight back to a tag. They go through the same write queue so there's no hardware conflict, but long-term one side should own this responsibility. Candidate: let the middleware be the single owner and disable/remove weight writeback from `SpoolmanManager`.

## Completed
- **NTAG215 / UID-only tags** — ISO14443A detection via PN5180ISO14443, UID published as `GENERIC_TAG_DETECTED`, LCD shows "Generic Tag / UID scan only"
- **Tag classification model** — `TagProtocol`, `TagKind`, `TagScanResult` with UID-length heuristic
- **LED FreeRTOS task** — non-blocking flash (3 white flashes on scan), persistent filament color after tag removal, breathing animation for low spool (≤100g)
- **SLIX2 WDT fix** — batched 16-block reads replace single 78-block transaction; eliminates cascading BUSY pin spin-wait timeouts
- **Project rename** — `openprinttag_scanner` → `spoolsense_scanner` throughout MQTT topics, HA discovery, BLE name, source files
- **Compile-time config** — all settings in `include/UserConfig.h`; BLE settings config removed
- **LCD truly optional** — `#ifdef ENABLE_LCD` gates I2C init, `lcdManager.begin()`, `lcdManager.startTask()`, and all LCD calls in `main.cpp`; `nullptr` passed to `ApplicationManager` when disabled
- **Built-in tag writer** — HTTP server on port 80, mDNS as `spoolsense.local`, REST API (`/api/status`, `/api/write-tag`, `/api/format-tag`), UI embedded in firmware via `TagWriterHTML.h`
