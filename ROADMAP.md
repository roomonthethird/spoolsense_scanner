# SpoolSense Roadmap

Feature roadmap across the SpoolSense ecosystem (scanner, middleware, installer, docs).

## Exploring

| Feature | Repo | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Direct Moonraker mode | Scanner | Scanner talks to Moonraker directly, no middleware needed |
| Bambu filament usage tracking → Spoolman | Scanner | Auto-deduct weight from Spoolman after Bambu prints (#62) |
| MIFARE Classic authentication | Scanner | Read Creality CFS and Bambu encrypted tags |
| GC9A01 round TFT display | Scanner | Community-requested round display variant |
| Multi-tag detection | Scanner | Read two spools simultaneously (dual antenna) |
| Spoolman write to tag | Middleware | Write spool data fetched from Spoolman directly to a tag |
| Bondtech INDX compatibility | Middleware | Support up to 8 toolheads (retail Q2 2026) |
